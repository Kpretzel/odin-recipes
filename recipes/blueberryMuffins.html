<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These muffins are extra large and yummy with the sugary-cinnamon crumb topping.</p>
<p>I usually double the recipe and fill the muffin cups just to the top edge for a wonderful, extra-generously-sized, deli-style muffin. Add extra blueberries too, if you want!</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<h4>Muffins:</h4>

<ul>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</ul>
<ul>3/4 cup white sugar</ul>
<ul>2 teaspoons baking powder</ul>
<ul>1/2 teaspoon salt</ul>
<ul>1/3 cup vegetable oil</ul>
<ul>1 egg</ul>
<ul>1/3 cup milk</ul>
<ul>1 cup fresh blueberries</ul>

<h4>Crumb topping:</h4>

<ul>1/2 cup white sugar</ul>
<ul>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</ul>
<ul>1/4 cup butter, cubed</ul>
<ul>1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</ul>

<br>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease 8 muffin cups or line with muffin liners.</ol>
<ol>Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl.</ol>
<ol>Pour oil into a small liquid measuring cup. Add egg and enough milk to reach the 1-cup mark. Stir until combined. Pour into flour mixture and mix just until batter is combined. Fold in blueberries. Set batter aside.</ol>
<ol>Combine sugar, flour, butter, and cinnamon for crumb topping in a small bowl. Mix with a fork until crumbly.</ol>
<ol>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling right to the top. Sprinkle with crumb topping.</ol>
<ol>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.</ol>
