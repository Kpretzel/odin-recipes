<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A simple but delicious crepe batter which can be made in a few minutes.</p>
<p>It's made from simple ingredients that everyone has on hand.</p>

<br>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>1 cup all-purpose flour</ul>
<ul>2 eggs</ul>
<ul>1/2 cup milk</ul>
<ul>1/2 cup water</ul>
<ul>1/4 teaspoon salt</ul>
<ul>2 tablespoons butter, melted</ul>

<br>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</ol>
<ol>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</ol>
<ol>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</ol>
