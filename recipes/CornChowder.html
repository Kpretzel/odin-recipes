<h2>Description</h2>
<p>My husband's grandmother used to make this chowder for him when he was a child.</p> 
<p>When we got married, she passed the recipe onto me. Enjoy!</p>

<br>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>1/2 cup diced bacon</ul>
<ul>4 medium potatoes, peeled and chopped</ul>
<ul>1 medium onion, chopped</ul>
<ul>2 cups water</ul>
<ul>3 cups cream-style corn</ul>
<ul>2 teaspoons salt</ul>
<ul>ground black pepper to taste</ul>
<ul>2 cups half-and-half</ul>

<br>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>Place the bacon in a large pot over medium-high heat, and cook until crisp. Drain and crumble, reserving about 2 tablespoons drippings in the pot.</ol>
<ol>Mix potatoes and onion into the pot with the crumbled bacon and reserved drippings. Cook and stir 5 minutes. Pour in the water, and stir in corn. Season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cover pot. Simmer 20 minutes, stirring frequently, until potatoes are tender.</ol>
<ol>Warm the half-and-half in a small saucepan until it bubbles. Remove from heat before it boils, and mix into the chowder just before serving.</ol>
